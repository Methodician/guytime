  <header>YOUR OWN PROFILE IN EDIT MODE</header>
  <section>
    <p>
      This would be the bottom of the "stack" (the home /landing page) and
      contain your own profile editable details, links to account management,
      friends list, viewing all your open chat rooms, settings, etc... and a
      link to view your profile in public mode (kind of like LinkedIn)
    </p>
    <a [routerLink]="['/guys']">Browse Guys</a>
    <p>
      You could also sign out from here with the icon in the upper right or
      something like that...
    </p>
    <a (click)="logout()">sign out</a>
